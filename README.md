# Deutsche Bundesliga Machine Learning

In this repository I have tried to predict the endresult (Home Win, Away Win, Draw) of the football matches of the german football bundesliga.
I have used the first 17 rounds of the season 2019/20 to train the models and then I predicted the upcoming matches.

I have tried different models:
-  decision tree
-  random forest
-  logistic regression
-  convolutional neural network

The predicted probabilities did I compare with the betting odds of Bet365.
Then I have experimented with different logics to simulate betting activities.

I haven't traded this models with the different logics with real money. But it was really interesting to see how the different models have performend.
